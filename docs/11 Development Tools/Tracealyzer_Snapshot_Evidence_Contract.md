# Tracealyzer Snapshot Evidence Contract

This document defines how PeepShow uses Tracealyzer-style RTOS traces during HW5 bring-up and Platform validation.

V1 policy uses snapshot/ring-buffer trace capture by default.

Streaming trace is optional future work and is not required for bring-up sign-off unless snapshot evidence proves insufficient.

## Scope

Defines:

- Tracealyzer snapshot evidence policy
- required RTOS and Platform event visibility
- trace capture artifact requirements
- memory and build-profile guardrails
- snapshot test workflow

Does not define:

- Tracealyzer licensing
- exact Percepio recorder source layout
- exact toolchain project integration
- paid streaming trace workflows
- product/shipping telemetry behavior

---

## Core Rule

Trace snapshots are bring-up evidence artifacts.

They may prove:

- ThreadX thread scheduling behavior
- owner-thread wake and block behavior
- queue/event flow
- runtime lifecycle transitions
- storage/USB ownership transitions
- sleep prepare and wake resume ordering
- fault lead-up context

They must not be used to claim:

- STOP current
- wake latency
- physical peripheral timing
- electrical behavior
- storage-media integrity
- display signal correctness
- BLE module behavior

Physical hardware claims still require measured HW5 evidence.

---

## Snapshot-First Policy

V1 uses snapshot/ring-buffer capture.

Expected workflow:

```text
enable trace build/profile
arm snapshot ring buffer
run one focused scenario
halt immediately after scenario, marker, timeout, or fault
dump trace snapshot
open/save Tracealyzer artifact
record artifact path in Brought_Up_Tracker
```

Rules:

- tests should be designed so the relevant behavior fits inside the snapshot window.
- each snapshot captures one focused scenario where possible.
- repeated short snapshots are preferred over a vague long-running trace during bring-up.
- streaming trace is deferred unless a bug cannot be captured in a bounded snapshot window.

Useful snapshot scenarios:

- boot to scheduler start
- each owner thread idle/block behavior
- display full/partial flush request
- storage request and completion
- USB MSC entry/export/reclaim
- package install validate/commit
- input event to runtime event path
- sensor request/event path
- audio cue/BBB request path
- sleep quiesce to STOP entry
- wake to owner revalidation
- runtime unit transition
- injected fault to safe path

---

## Tracealyzer Integration Expectations

Tracealyzer support is a development/build option.

Expected ThreadX integration requirements:

- ThreadX event trace enabled in the trace build
- recorder initialized during ThreadX application setup
- snapshot/ring-buffer storage configured with a bounded RAM budget
- trace start policy selected per build profile
- trace buffer dump procedure documented in bring-up workflow

Rules:

- trace integration must be behind build flags or a trace build profile.
- trace recorder source/config must not be edited ad hoc during normal bring-up.
- trace configuration must be recorded with evidence.
- trace instrumentation must not require USB MSC or CDC developer mode.
- trace snapshot capture must work with debugger halt/dump first.

---

## Required RTOS Visibility

Trace snapshots should show:

- thread creation/start
- thread ready/running/blocking transitions
- queue send/receive activity where available
- event flag waits/signals where available
- mutex/semaphore use where available
- timer behavior where available
- CPU idle/residency approximation where available

Minimum owner threads to identify by stable names:

- `thPower`
- `thDisplay`
- `thAudio`
- `thInput`
- `thUI`
- `thRuntime`
- `thStorage`
- `thSensor`
- `thComm`

Trace naming must match [[RTOS_Ownership_and_Queue_Topology]].

---

## Required PeepShow User Events

ThreadX trace alone is not enough.

PeepShow must emit custom trace events for Platform and Engine state transitions that are not automatically visible as RTOS events.

Required custom event classes:

| Event Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mode.transition` | system/runtime mode state changes |
| `owner.state` | owner FSM state transition |
| `queue.overflow` | dropped or rejected owner request |
| `sleep.quiesce_begin` | power owner begins quiesce |
| `sleep.quiesce_ack` | owner acknowledges quiesce |
| `sleep.enter` | Platform attempts sleep entry |
| `wake.reason` | normalized wake reason classified |
| `resume.owner_revalidate` | owner validates hardware/state after wake |
| `display.flush` | display flush begin/end/fault |
| `storage.owner` | storage mount/export/reclaim/install transition |
| `usb.personality` | MSC or CDC personality selected |
| `runtime.lifecycle` | runtime host mount/start/suspend/resume/stop/unmount |
| `package.install` | package stage/validate/commit/rollback event |
| `fault.path` | fault classification and safe route |

Rules:

- custom event IDs must be stable.
- event payloads must be bounded.
- high-rate events must be filterable.
- custom trace events must not expose protected storage, raw pointers, register dumps, or package private data.
- middleware behavior such as FileX, LevelX, USBX, or BLE owner flow should be represented by owner-level custom events when automatic middleware trace visibility is unavailable.

---

## Memory Budget

Trace buffers are development-only memory consumers.

Rules:

- trace buffer size must be explicitly configured.
- trace buffer placement must be documented.
- trace buffers must not consume SRAM4 display/retention space unless an explicit trace build says so and the run is not used for SRAM4/power evidence.
- trace build memory usage must be excluded from shipping memory budgets.
- any bring-up evidence using trace instrumentation must record the trace buffer size and configuration.

Recommended policy:

- start with a small snapshot ring buffer.
- increase buffer size only for a specific scenario.
- do not tune normal firmware memory layout around trace-only needs.

---

## Power And Timing Caveats

Trace instrumentation changes timing and power behavior.

Rules:

- trace-enabled runs may prove ordering and scheduling.
- trace-enabled runs must not be used as final current, STOP residency, or wake-latency evidence unless the test explicitly accepts trace overhead.
- compare timing-sensitive results only between runs with the same trace configuration.
- trace-disabled confirmation is required for final low-power measurements.

---

## Evidence Artifact Requirements

Each Tracealyzer snapshot evidence entry must record:

- test case ID
- scenario name
- board revision
- firmware commit
- knobs hash/version
- trace build/profile
- trace recorder configuration
- trace buffer size and placement
- capture trigger or halt point
- Tracealyzer artifact path
- summary of expected ordering
- pass/fail result
- issue ID for failures

The artifact should be linked from [[Brought_Up_Tracker]].

---

## Snapshot Acceptance Criteria

A snapshot is useful bring-up evidence only if:

- the relevant threads are named and identifiable
- the relevant owner events are visible
- the interesting scenario is inside the captured window
- expected ordering can be checked from the trace
- trace configuration is recorded
- artifact path is retained

Snapshots that miss the relevant window are useful debugging attempts, but not completion evidence.

---

## Streaming Trace Policy

Streaming trace is deferred.

It may be reconsidered if:

- a failure cannot be captured with repeated snapshot scenarios
- long-run thread behavior must be proven visually
- the chosen debugger/transport supports reliable Tracealyzer streaming
- RAM snapshot buffers are too small for required evidence
- the project accepts the tool/license/setup requirements

Until then, bring-up documentation should assume snapshot capture.

---

## Validation Cases

1. trace build boots to ThreadX scheduler with owner thread names visible.
2. each owner thread blocks when idle and wakes on its expected queue/event path.
3. display flush scenario shows request, owner wake, transfer begin/end event, and return to idle.
4. storage request scenario shows request, owner wake, operation, completion, and no competing storage owner.
5. USB MSC scenario shows MSC personality selection and no CDC developer personality.
6. sleep quiesce snapshot shows owner acknowledgements before sleep entry.
7. wake snapshot shows wake reason classification before owner resume validation completes.
8. runtime lifecycle snapshot shows mount/start/suspend/resume/stop/unmount ordering.
9. injected fault snapshot shows fault classification and safe route.
10. trace-enabled evidence records trace config, buffer size, firmware commit, knobs hash, and artifact path.

---

## Rule

Use Tracealyzer snapshots to prove RTOS and owner-thread behavior during bring-up.

Use measured HW5 evidence to prove hardware behavior.
