# BLE Communication Contract

This document defines the HW5 BLE/NINA module boundary and required state machine.

BLE is a Platform communication service. It exposes generic communication capabilities to the Engine, not game-specific radio behavior.

Engine and Reference Game code must not own the UART, module reset pins, strap pins, flow-control pins, persistent bonding data, or BLE command protocol directly.

## Hardware Path

Module: `NINA-B112-04B`.

Transport:

- `LPUART1`
- hardware RTS/CTS flow control
- exact module command/profile behavior is a bring-up item

| Signal | MCU Pin | CubeMX Signal | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| UART TX | `PA2` | `LPUART1_TX` | `thComm` |
| UART RX | `PA3` | `LPUART1_RX` | `thComm` |
| UART RTS | `PB12` | `LPUART1_RTS` | `thComm` |
| UART CTS | `PB13` | `LPUART1_CTS` | `thComm` |
| Mode / strap | `PC4` | `NINA_SW1` | `thComm` |
| Mode / strap | `PC5` | `NINA_SW2` | `thComm` |
| Reset | `PC6` | `NINA_NRST` | `thComm` |
| DTR | `PC7` | `NINA_DTR` | `thComm` |
| DSR | `PC8` | `NINA_DSR` | `thComm` |

No BLE wake IRQ is assigned in the current `.ioc`, and HW5 has no planned BLE wake use case.

NINA `RESET_N` is active low. Firmware safe default is reset asserted low until `thComm` intentionally brings the module online.

NINA system-control pins are configuration-sensitive. `NINA_SW1`, `NINA_SW2`, `NINA_DTR`, and `NINA_DSR` should be CubeMX-configured as high-Z input or analog/no-pull by default unless a validated bring-up sequence explicitly needs output drive.

## NINA Control Signal Notes

The following notes come from the NINA/u-connectXpress control-signal summary provided for HW5 planning.

System control inputs:

- `RESET_N` resets the module and is active low.
- `SWITCH_2` driven low during startup restores UART serial settings to default values.
- `SWITCH_2` can be used to open a Bluetooth LE connection with a peripheral device.
- `SWITCH_1` and `SWITCH_2` driven low during startup can enter the bootloader.
- `SWITCH_1` and `SWITCH_2` driven low during startup and held low for 10 seconds can exit bootloader mode and restore factory defaults.

UART-side auxiliary pins:

- `DSR` can be configured to enter command mode, disconnect or toggle connectable status, enable/disable the rest of the UART interface, or enter/wake from sleep.
- `DTR` can be configured to indicate system mode, SPS peer connection, bonded BLE device connection, or Bluetooth LE GAP connection.

HW5 policy:

- do not drive `NINA_SW1` or `NINA_SW2` low during module reset release unless intentionally entering a documented NINA startup mode
- do not use `NINA_DSR` or `NINA_DTR` until direction, polarity, and configured function are documented in the BLE bring-up evidence
- current `.ioc` assigns NINA auxiliary GPIO to `GPIO_Analog` high-Z/no-pull defaults; preserve this before generated firmware is allowed to release `NINA_NRST`

## Ownership

- `thComm` is the sole owner of `LPUART1` and BLE control GPIO.
- Other threads submit communication requests through `qCommCmd` or approved Engine communication APIs.
- `thComm` owns module reset, strap sequencing, command framing, timeouts, retries, pairing state, and health publication.
- `thStorage` owns persistent storage of pairing/bonding records on request from `thComm`.
- No Engine or Reference Game code may touch `LPUART1`, NINA GPIO, BLE module commands, or bonding storage directly.

## Intended Uses

BLE is primarily for:

- multiplayer
- possible companion app support
- pairing/bonding
- diagnostics where explicitly enabled

BLE is off unless a mode explicitly requests it, such as multiplayer, pairing, companion-app connection, or an approved diagnostic session.

## Current CubeMX Baseline

- `LPUART1` baud rate is `9600`.
- `LPUART1` clock source is HSI at `16 MHz`.
- RTS/CTS pins are assigned.
- First BLE implementation should use interrupt-driven RX/TX static ring buffers. UART DMA is intentionally deferred until throughput or CPU measurements justify it.
- No BLE wake IRQ is currently assigned.
- `NINA_NRST` is active-low reset. `NINA_SW1`, `NINA_SW2`, `NINA_DTR`, and `NINA_DSR` should default high-Z/no-pull until a validated NINA function requires them.

## Required Knobs

The following values must become compile-time knobs before implementation:

| Knob | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_RESET_ASSERT_MS` | minimum reset assertion time |
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_BOOT_WAIT_MS` | maximum wait for module boot-ready evidence |
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_CMD_TIMEOUT_MS` | command/response timeout |
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_PAIRING_TIMEOUT_MS` | maximum pairing/bonding operation time |
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_MAX_RECOVERY_RETRIES` | bounded recovery retries before fault escalation |
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_RX_BUF_BYTES` | static RX buffer size |
| `KNOB_COMM_BLE_TX_BUF_BYTES` | static TX buffer size |

BLE async transfer policy is interrupt-driven RX/TX static ring buffers first. UART DMA must remain disabled unless a later measured throughput or CPU-load requirement justifies it.

## UART Buffering Policy

First BLE bring-up uses interrupt-driven UART servicing with static RX/TX ring buffers.

Rules:

- RX and TX buffers are fixed-size, statically allocated rings.
- IRQ handlers only move bytes and signal `thComm`; protocol parsing remains in `thComm`.
- All command/response waits are bounded by explicit timeouts.
- UART DMA is not part of first bring-up.
- DMA may be reconsidered only after measured throughput or CPU-load evidence shows interrupt-driven rings are insufficient.

## Public Capability Model

The Platform may expose generic capabilities such as:

- BLE available/unavailable
- multiplayer session advertise/join/leave
- companion-app advertise/connect/disconnect
- pairing/bonding status
- bounded message send
- bounded message receive
- diagnostic module info

The Engine consumes capabilities, not hardware commands.

Reference Game code consumes Engine communication APIs only.

## Pairing And Bonding

Pairing/bonding data must be persistent.

Rules:

- bonding records are stored in protected Platform storage, not host-exposed staging storage
- `thComm` requests bonding record reads/writes through `thStorage`
- bonding writes must be power-fail safe
- bonding records must be versioned or invalidatable
- pairing/bonding failure must not corrupt existing valid records
- erase/reset of bonding data must be an explicit Platform command

Invalid transitions must be rejected and logged.

## Request Rules

- All send/receive requests must be bounded by static RX/TX ring-buffer limits.
- No request may block indefinitely waiting for BLE response.
- No dynamic allocation is allowed in the communication hot path; RX/TX rings are statically allocated.
- New requests are rejected during `BLE_SUSPENDING`, `BLE_SUSPENDED`, and `BLE_ERROR`.
- Engine-facing APIs report capability status instead of exposing module internals.

## Mode Behavior

| Mode | BLE Policy |
|---|---|
| `SHELL` | off by default; allowed for pairing, settings, diagnostics, or companion-app flow when explicitly requested |
| `LP_GRAPH` | off |
| `LP_TEMPLATE` | off unless an Engine capability request explicitly owns a communication session while awake |
| `RT_SCENE` | allowed for multiplayer only when transfer latency will not break real-time budgets |
| `INSTALLER` | disabled unless explicitly used for diagnostics; USB/storage ownership remains primary |

BLE does not wake the device in HW5.

## Power Rules

- BLE defaults off unless multiplayer, companion, pairing, or diagnostics explicitly requests it.
- Module reset is held asserted while BLE is off; strap/control pins are high-Z/no-pull unless required by validated bring-up or operation. If a validated function needs one, `thComm` reconfigures that pin deliberately and restores the safe default afterward.
- `thComm` must quiesce UART activity before STOP entry.
- If BLE is not actively needed, module should be held in the lowest safe state.
- Any active BLE connection must express power intent to `thPower`; `thPower` remains the authority on sleep depth.

## Failure Policy

BLE failure is non-fatal.

On BLE fault:

- stop accepting communication requests
- preserve existing valid bonding records
- publish communication health fault
- allow bounded recovery through reset/config path
- continue local gameplay/shell behavior without BLE where possible

## Validation Cases

1. reset/boot/config sequence reaches `BLE_IDLE` with bounded timing
2. boot timeout routes to `BLE_ERROR`
3. advertise start/stop works without leaking connection state
4. connect/disconnect events are reflected in state
5. pairing/bonding completes and persists a record safely
6. pairing/bonding failure preserves existing valid records
7. bounded TX/RX succeeds and returns to `BLE_CONNECTED`
8. transfer timeout routes to `BLE_ERROR`
9. quiesce during idle/advertising/connected/transfer reaches `BLE_SUSPENDED`
10. resume revalidates module readiness before accepting requests
11. recovery retries are bounded and escalate when exhausted
12. BLE remains off during normal non-multiplayer low-power operation
