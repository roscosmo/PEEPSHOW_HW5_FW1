# Audio Contract

This document defines HW5 audio ownership, playback architecture, state machines, and power coordination.

Audio is owned by Platform. Engine and Reference Game code request symbolic music, SFX, and BBB behavior; they must not control SAI, DMA, LPTIM, GPIO, or amplifier pins directly.

## Hardware Paths

| Path | Hardware | MCU Signals | Purpose | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Speaker | `MAX98357AETE+T` into 1 W 20 mm speaker | `SAI1_A`: `PA8` SCK, `PB9` FS, `PA10` SD | music and sampled SFX | `thAudio` |
| Speaker shutdown | MAX98357A `SD` pin | `PC9` `SD_MODE` | speaker amp shutdown/enable | `thAudio` |
| BBB / piezo | `PAM8904EGPR` into piezo buzzer | `PB2` `BUZZ` / `LPTIM1_CH1` | beeps, boops, buzzes, procedural tones | `thAudio` |

`SD_MODE` low places the MAX98357A in shutdown. `SD_MODE` high enables the speaker amp.

The PAM8904 path auto-shuts down when no DIN signal is present.

## Ownership

- `thAudio` is the sole owner of SAI1, audio DMA, LPTIM1/BUZZ, `SD_MODE`, mixer state, decoder state, and audio fault recovery.
- Other threads submit commands through `qAudioCmd`.
- Clock profile requests flow through `thPower` only.
- Speaker and BBB paths may play simultaneously.

## Audio Architecture

HW5 audio has two output classes under one owner:

```text
thAudio
|-- Speaker path: sampled/mixed audio over SAI1/I2S to MAX98357A
`-- BBB path: procedural symbolic audio over LPTIM1/BUZZ to PAM8904
```

Speaker path:

- 16 kHz mono output
- 16-bit PCM DMA output
- 4-bit IMA ADPCM assets, mono, 16 kHz
- 1 music voice
- 5 SFX voices
- music/SFX mixing to mono PCM
- volume, mute, fade, ducking, priority, and preemption

BBB path:

- built-in system BBB patterns
- package/game BBB pattern assets
- bounded procedural tones
- bounded procedural sweeps
- short melodies/sequences
- priority and preemption
- no PCM streaming

## Data Source Rules

Audio runtime sources are limited to:

- installed/raw package assets
- built-in system assets
- validated BBB pattern assets
- bounded procedural BBB requests

Rules:

- no FileX/FAT reads during active playback
- SFX are fully loaded into RAM before playback
- music is fully preloaded or read from raw installed blob storage into a bounded ring buffer
- ADPCM decode writes into bounded PCM buffers
- no runtime heap dependency in playback paths

## Public Request Model

Engine and Reference Game may request:

- `AUDIO_PLAY_MUSIC(id, loop, fade_ms, volume)`
- `AUDIO_STOP_MUSIC(fade_ms)`
- `AUDIO_PAUSE_MUSIC()`
- `AUDIO_RESUME_MUSIC()`
- `AUDIO_PLAY_SFX(id, priority, volume)`
- `AUDIO_STOP_SFX(id_or_group)`
- `AUDIO_PLAY_BBB_PATTERN(pattern_id, priority)`
- `AUDIO_PLAY_BBB_TONE(freq_hz, duration_ms, drive_class, envelope)`
- `AUDIO_PLAY_BBB_SWEEP(start_freq_hz, end_freq_hz, duration_ms, curve)`
- `AUDIO_PLAY_BBB_SEQUENCE(step_table_id, priority)`
- `AUDIO_SET_VOLUME(bus, value)`
- `AUDIO_SET_MUTE(bus, enabled)`

Audio buses:

- `master`
- `music`
- `sfx`
- `bbb`

Platform may reject requests that exceed validated bounds.

## BBB Pattern Model

BBB is procedural symbolic audio, not a second PCM audio engine.

BBB sequence assets should be tiny validated command lists, for example:

```text
tone 1200 Hz 40 ms
gap 20 ms
tone 1800 Hz 40 ms
gap 20 ms
sweep 2200 Hz -> 900 Hz 120 ms
```

Allowed BBB steps:

- tone
- gap
- sweep
- repeat group with bounded count
- drive/envelope change from a fixed allowed set

Rejected BBB requests:

- frequency outside allowed range
- duration outside allowed range
- unbounded repeat
- too many sequence steps
- unsupported curve/envelope
- request that conflicts with higher-priority BBB output

## Required Knobs

| Knob | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KNOB_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE_HZ` | target PCM output rate, initially 16000 |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_MIXER_SFX_VOICES` | SFX voice count, fixed at 5 for HW5 target |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_PCM_DMA_FRAMES` | PCM DMA buffer frame count |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_MUSIC_RING_BYTES` | bounded music ring-buffer size |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_ADPCM_BLOCK_BYTES` | ADPCM decode block size |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_FADE_STEP_MS` | fade update cadence |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_DUCK_RELEASE_MS` | ducking release time |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_BBB_MAX_STEPS` | maximum BBB sequence steps |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_BBB_MAX_DURATION_MS` | maximum BBB request duration |
| `KNOB_AUDIO_RECOVERY_MAX_RETRIES` | bounded recovery attempts |

## Audio Owner FSM

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AUDIO_OFF` | audio hardware inactive, speaker amp shutdown, BBB idle |
| `AUDIO_INIT` | SAI/DMA/LPTIM/mixer/static buffers initialized |
| `AUDIO_IDLE` | ready but not playing |
| `AUDIO_ACTIVE` | speaker path and/or BBB path active |
| `AUDIO_SUSPENDING` | draining/stopping outputs for sleep or mode transition |
| `AUDIO_SUSPENDED` | audio quiesced |
| `AUDIO_RECOVERING` | bounded recovery after underrun/DMA/protocol fault |
| `AUDIO_ERROR` | major but non-fatal audio fault |

## Speaker Playback FSM

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SPK_OFF` | `SD_MODE` low, SAI/DMA inactive |
| `SPK_ENABLE` | `SD_MODE` high, amp enable/settle path |
| `SPK_IDLE` | speaker path ready, no active voice |
| `SPK_PRELOAD` | SFX or music metadata/buffer preflight |
| `SPK_BUFFERING` | ADPCM decode/ring-buffer fill before playback |
| `SPK_PLAYING` | mixer producing 16-bit PCM for DMA |
| `SPK_DRAINING` | fade/drain before stop or suspend |
| `SPK_PAUSED` | playback state retained but DMA/output stopped |
| `SPK_UNDERRUN` | mixer or ring buffer failed to provide data on time |
| `SPK_ERROR` | SAI/DMA/amp/mixer fault |

Speaker rules:

- exactly 1 music voice
- exactly 5 SFX voices
- music and SFX mix into one mono PCM stream
- SFX priority may preempt lower-priority SFX voices
- music ducking is allowed for important SFX
- fades must be bounded and deterministic
- DMA ISR only signals; decode/mix/refill occurs in `thAudio`

## BBB / Piezo FSM

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BBB_OFF` | no BUZZ/LPTIM output |
| `BBB_READY` | BBB path ready for request |
| `BBB_PATTERN_LOAD` | built-in, asset, or procedural request validated and loaded |
| `BBB_PLAYING` | tone/sweep/sequence output active |
| `BBB_DRAINING` | final step or stop/preempt drain |
| `BBB_ERROR` | LPTIM/GPIO/pattern fault |

BBB rules:

- BBB may play concurrently with speaker output.
- BBB requests are symbolic/procedural, not PCM streams.
- BBB pattern assets must be validated by the asset pipeline.
- BBB output must stop cleanly so PAM8904 can auto-shutdown.

## Power Coordination

- Active speaker playback raises the power/performance floor and blocks deep sleep.
- Active BBB output may block deep sleep for the duration of the pattern.
- `thAudio` publishes active/inactive state to `thPower`.
- Before deep sleep: drain or stop playback, stop DMA, stop BBB output, place `SD_MODE` low, and acknowledge quiesce.
- Resume must revalidate clocks, SAI, DMA, and LPTIM before accepting requests.

## Failure Policy

Audio failure is major but non-fatal.

On failure:

- quarantine audio path if recovery is not immediately possible
- keep shell/game running silently where possible
- publish visible/audible fault only if another output path remains valid
- preserve diagnostics for bring-up
- recover through bounded attempts only

Examples of audio faults:

- DMA underrun
- ADPCM decode failure
- mixer overrun or invalid voice state
- SAI/DMA error
- BBB pattern validation failure
- LPTIM/BUZZ output fault

## Validation Cases

1. speaker enable/idle/shutdown drives `SD_MODE` correctly
2. 16 kHz mono ADPCM SFX decodes and plays correctly
3. 1 music voice plus 5 overlapping SFX voices mix without underrun
4. SFX priority/preemption works deterministically
5. fade, mute, volume, and ducking behave correctly
6. music ring-buffer path never reads from FileX/FAT during active playback
7. BBB built-in pattern plays and stops cleanly
8. BBB procedural tone, sweep, and sequence requests validate bounds
9. speaker and BBB play concurrently
10. quiesce/resume leaves no active DMA/LPTIM output stale
11. injected underrun routes to recovery or audio quarantine
12. installer mode isolates audio unless explicitly allowed for diagnostics
