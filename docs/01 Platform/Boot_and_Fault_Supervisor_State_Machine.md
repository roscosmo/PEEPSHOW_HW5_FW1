# Boot and Fault Supervisor State Machine

This document defines the HW5 boot sequence, recovery routing, and global fault supervision contract.

The boot and fault supervisor is Platform-owned. It may start the Engine and Reference Game only after required Platform invariants are satisfied.

## Scope

Defines:

- deterministic boot phase progression
- first-boot and missing-settings behavior
- safe-mode routing
- global fault classification
- persistent fault evidence policy
- fatal fault handling

Does not define:

- per-peripheral recovery internals
- Reference Game launch policy beyond Platform readiness
- MCU ROM bootloader behavior once `BOOT0` is sampled high

---

## Boot Principles

- Normal boot must not reach normal shell, Engine runtime, or Reference Game runtime until required settings and calibration records are valid.
- Missing settings are not fatal, but they force safe-mode setup/calibration before normal functionality.
- Missing joystick calibration forces joystick calibration safe mode.
- First boot ignores START shipping intent because there is no user data to preserve yet.
- `BTN_BOOT` / `PH3-BOOT0` is the MCU hardware bootloader pin. If it is held high early enough to enter ROM bootloader mode, application firmware does not run and cannot classify it.
- If application firmware is running, `BTN_BOOT` remains reserved for maintenance/recovery policy only and is never normal Engine/Game input.
- Boot must be useful without the Reference Game installed.

Invalid transitions must be rejected and logged if logging is available.

## First-Boot And Missing-Settings Policy

First boot is the case where protected storage has no valid setup/settings record.

First boot must:

- enter safe-mode setup/calibration before normal shell/runtime
- ignore START shipping intent because there is nothing to save or back up yet
- create required settings records through `thStorage`
- create required calibration records before normal input is considered usable
- record setup completion only after required records are valid

If settings are missing or invalid after a non-first boot:

- normal shell/runtime must not start
- safe-mode repair/setup must start
- existing valid calibration or bonding records may be preserved if independently valid

If joystick calibration is missing or invalid:

- normal joystick input must not start
- the device enters joystick calibration safe mode
- calibration safe mode must be navigable with encoder and L/R button fallback controls

---

## BOOT0 / Maintenance Button Policy

`BTN_BOOT` is physically `PH3-BOOT0`.

Rules:

- Holding `BTN_BOOT` high during MCU boot may force STM32 ROM bootloader entry before application firmware runs.
- Application firmware must not claim it can intercept that early bootloader path.
- If application firmware is running and later sees `BTN_BOOT`, it may classify it only as maintenance/recovery input.
- `BTN_BOOT` must never be exposed to Engine or Reference Game input mapping.

---

## Display Failure During Boot

Display is required for normal standalone operation.

If display init fails during boot:

- classify as fatal for normal operation
- emit diagnostic output through the easiest available bring-up channel, such as debugger, SWO, serial, or fault log, depending on what is alive
- do not launch normal shell/runtime blindly
- preserve enough evidence to diagnose the failure when storage or debugger output is available

A deliberate blind recovery mode may be added later, but it must be documented as a separate recovery policy before implementation.

## Fault Supervisor FSM

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FAULT_HEALTHY` | no active fault affects system capability |
| `FAULT_CAPTURE` | fault source, subsystem state, event, reset context, and timestamp are captured |
| `FAULT_CLASSIFY` | fault is classified by severity and required route |
| `FAULT_RECOVERING` | bounded subsystem or system recovery attempt is active |
| `FAULT_DEGRADED` | system continues with an unavailable non-critical capability |
| `FAULT_SAFE_MODE` | normal operation blocked; minimal recovery/calibration/diagnostic UI active |
| `FAULT_FATAL` | unrecoverable or required capability failure; halt, controlled reset, or latched fault behavior |

## Fault Classes

| Class | Meaning | Examples | Required Route |
|---|---|---|---|
| informational | noteworthy but does not affect capability | transient rejected request, invalid transition | log if available |
| degraded | optional capability unavailable | BLE failure, IMU failure, light sensor failure | continue with capability disabled |
| major recoverable | important subsystem failed but recovery may work | audio fault, external flash transient, I2C bus recovery | bounded recovery, then safe/degraded/fatal by subsystem policy |
| safe-mode required | normal operation is unsafe or unusable | missing settings, missing joystick calibration, storage/settings unavailable | `FAULT_SAFE_MODE` |
| fatal | required standalone capability unavailable or unrecoverable invariant broken | display failure, unrecoverable boot clock/kernel fault | `FAULT_FATAL` |

## Persistent Fault Evidence

Fault evidence should be stored in the protected external-flash fault-log ring once `thStorage` is available.

Persistent fault record should include:

- reset reason
- boot phase
- fault class
- subsystem ID
- subsystem state
- triggering event
- hardware status snapshot where cheap and safe
- timestamp or monotonic boot counter if available
- recovery attempt count

Rules:

- fault logs are not host-writable and are not directly host-exposed
- fault log writes are append/ring style and must preserve the previous valid record on failed update
- early boot faults before storage is available must use the easiest available diagnostic output
- debugger/SWO/serial output is acceptable during bring-up when storage is not yet available
- fault logging must not block fault containment

---

## Supervisor Responsibilities

- Own global boot progress state publication.
- Aggregate subsystem fault signals and apply escalation policy.
- Trigger safe-mode routing when normal operation is unsafe or setup is incomplete.
- Prevent normal shell/runtime launch until required settings and calibration are valid.
- Preserve fault evidence through `thStorage` when storage is available.
- Expose boot/fault state to diagnostics and [[Brought_Up_Tracker]] evidence.

---

## Validation Cases

1. successful first application boot enters setup/calibration safe mode
2. valid settings and calibration allow `BOOT_RUNTIME_READY`
3. missing settings enter safe-mode setup
4. missing joystick calibration enters joystick calibration safe mode
5. START shipping intent is ignored during first boot
6. `BTN_BOOT` hardware ROM bootloader limitation is documented and not claimed as firmware-handled early boot input
7. display init failure produces the easiest available diagnostic evidence and does not launch normal runtime
8. non-critical BLE/IMU/light fault can degrade without fatal boot
9. storage-backed fault record is written after storage is available
10. early boot fault emits debugger/SWO/serial evidence if available
11. bounded recovery exhaustion escalates by subsystem criticality
