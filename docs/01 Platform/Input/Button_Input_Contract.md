# Button Input Contract

This document defines HW5 button ownership, electrical behavior, classification, and state machines.

Buttons are Platform input devices. Platform emits raw logical button events and chord masks. UI, Engine, and Reference Game code map those events contextually.

No button is a universal accept/back/action key at the Platform layer.

## Hardware Path

| Button | MCU Pin | CubeMX Signal | Electrical Behavior | Owner | Normal Game Input |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BTN_START` | `PA4` | `EXTI4` | pullup, button pulls down through BAT54 into ADP5360 `MR` path, active low | `thInput` / `thPower` policy | yes |
| `BTN_A` | `PB5` | `EXTI5` | pulldown, 0.1 uF debounce cap, active high | `thInput` | yes |
| `BTN_B` | `PB6` | `EXTI6` | pulldown, 0.1 uF debounce cap, active high | `thInput` | yes |
| `BTN_L` | `PB7` | `EXTI7` | pulldown, 0.1 uF debounce cap, active high | `thInput` | yes |
| `BTN_R` | `PB8` | `EXTI8` | pulldown, 0.1 uF debounce cap, active high | `thInput` | yes |
| `BTN_BOOT` | `PH3-BOOT0` | `EXTI3` when application is running | BOOT0 pin, pulldown, active high; can force ROM bootloader before firmware runs | ROM bootloader before app, then `thInput` maintenance policy | no |

## Ownership

- `thInput` owns EXTI event capture, debounce, hold timing, repeat timing, and chord classification.
- `thPower` consumes Start-button power intent and shipping-mode warning events.
- `BTN_BOOT` is hardware `BOOT0`. If sampled high at reset, STM32 ROM bootloader may run before application firmware can classify it. If application firmware is running, `BTN_BOOT` is reserved for system maintenance/recovery behavior and must not be exposed as normal Engine/Game input.
- UI, Engine, and Reference Game code consume logical button events and chord masks only.

## Start Button / ADP5360 Shipping Mode

`BTN_START` is electrically tied into the ADP5360 `MR` path.

Hardware behavior:

- short and normal long presses are firmware-observable button input
- holding Start for the ADP5360 shipping threshold enters shipping mode
- in shipping mode, pressing Start for the required wake duration exits shipping mode

Contract:

- Firmware may detect Start hold duration and present countdown/warning UX.
- Firmware should begin save/quiesce preparation before the shipping threshold, not only near the final threshold.
- Firmware must not assume it can prevent shipping mode once the hardware threshold is reached.
- Game/save systems must treat Start shipping intent as a serious power-loss-adjacent event.

Timing details:

- ADP5360 shipping-mode threshold: approximately 12 s by hardware design.
- ADP5360 shipping-mode exit press: approximately 200 ms by hardware design.
- Firmware warning/quiesce lead time is policy-defined and must become a knob.

## Required Knobs

| Knob | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KNOB_INPUT_BTN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS_MS` | debounce interval after active edge |
| `KNOB_INPUT_BTN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE_MS` | debounce interval after release edge |
| `KNOB_INPUT_BTN_LONG_PRESS_MS` | normal long-press threshold |
| `KNOB_INPUT_BTN_REPEAT_START_MS` | hold duration before repeat events begin |
| `KNOB_INPUT_BTN_REPEAT_PERIOD_MS` | repeat event cadence |
| `KNOB_INPUT_BTN_STUCK_MS` | stuck-button fault threshold |
| `KNOB_INPUT_CHORD_WINDOW_MS` | window for combining button presses into a chord |
| `KNOB_INPUT_START_SHIP_PREP_MS` | Start-hold duration where save/quiesce preparation begins |
| `KNOB_INPUT_START_SHIP_WARN_MS` | Start-hold duration where visible warning/countdown begins |
| `KNOB_INPUT_START_SHIP_IMMINENT_MS` | Start-hold duration where shipping-mode entry is considered imminent |

The ship-prep, warning, and imminent thresholds must be below the hardware shipping-mode threshold.

## Per-Button Physical State Machine

Each physical button has an independent FSM.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BTN_DISABLED` | button ignored by policy, except hardware wake if explicitly armed |
| `BTN_RELEASED` | stable inactive state |
| `BTN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS` | active edge received; waiting for debounce confirmation |
| `BTN_PRESSED` | stable active press confirmed |
| `BTN_HELD` | press duration exceeded long-press threshold |
| `BTN_REPEAT` | repeat events active while held, if enabled by policy |
| `BTN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE` | release edge received; waiting for debounce confirmation |
| `BTN_STUCK` | button active longer than stuck threshold |
| `BTN_ERROR` | impossible transition, GPIO fault, or classifier inconsistency |

## Per-Button Events

| Event | Source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EV_BTN_EDGE_ACTIVE` | EXTI / input scan | electrical active edge observed |
| `EV_BTN_EDGE_INACTIVE` | EXTI / input scan | electrical release edge observed |
| `EV_BTN_DEBOUNCE_DONE` | `thInput` timer | debounce interval elapsed |
| `EV_BTN_LONG_THRESHOLD` | `thInput` timer | normal long-press threshold reached |
| `EV_BTN_REPEAT_THRESHOLD` | `thInput` timer | repeat may begin |
| `EV_BTN_REPEAT_TICK` | `thInput` timer | repeat event due |
| `EV_BTN_STUCK_THRESHOLD` | `thInput` timer | held too long for normal behavior |
| `EV_BTN_DISABLE_REQ` | input/power policy | disable button events |
| `EV_BTN_ENABLE_REQ` | input/power policy | enable button events |
| `EV_BTN_FAULT` | `thInput` | GPIO/classifier fault |
| `EV_RECOVER_OK` | `thInput` | recovery completed |

## Physical Transition Rules

| Current | Event | Next | Required Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BTN_RELEASED` | `EV_BTN_EDGE_ACTIVE` | `BTN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS` | start press debounce timer |
| `BTN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS` | `EV_BTN_DEBOUNCE_DONE` and active | `BTN_PRESSED` | emit down/press candidate to classifier |
| `BTN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS` | `EV_BTN_DEBOUNCE_DONE` and inactive | `BTN_RELEASED` | reject bounce |
| `BTN_PRESSED` | `EV_BTN_LONG_THRESHOLD` | `BTN_HELD` | emit long-press candidate if policy allows |
| `BTN_HELD` | `EV_BTN_REPEAT_THRESHOLD` | `BTN_REPEAT` | start repeat cadence if repeat enabled |
| `BTN_REPEAT` | `EV_BTN_REPEAT_TICK` | `BTN_REPEAT` | emit repeat candidate if focus accepts repeats |
| `BTN_PRESSED` / `BTN_HELD` / `BTN_REPEAT` | `EV_BTN_EDGE_INACTIVE` | `BTN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE` | start release debounce timer |
| `BTN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE` | `EV_BTN_DEBOUNCE_DONE` and inactive | `BTN_RELEASED` | emit release and final duration |
| `BTN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE` | `EV_BTN_DEBOUNCE_DONE` and active | previous active state | reject release bounce |
| any active state | `EV_BTN_STUCK_THRESHOLD` | `BTN_STUCK` | emit stuck fault, suppress normal repeats |
| any state | `EV_BTN_DISABLE_REQ` | `BTN_DISABLED` | suppress logical events |
| `BTN_DISABLED` | `EV_BTN_ENABLE_REQ` | `BTN_RELEASED` | re-sample inactive/active level |
| any state | `EV_BTN_FAULT` | `BTN_ERROR` | publish input fault |
| `BTN_ERROR` | `EV_RECOVER_OK` | `BTN_RELEASED` | clear only after GPIO validation |

Invalid transitions must be rejected and logged.

## Button Classifier State Machine

The classifier turns physical button events into logical events and chord masks.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BTN_CLASSIFIER_IDLE` | no pending button classification |
| `BTN_CLASSIFIER_SINGLE_PENDING` | one press is pending chord-window expiry |
| `BTN_CLASSIFIER_CHORD_PENDING` | multiple buttons observed inside chord window |
| `BTN_CLASSIFIER_CHORD_ACTIVE` | chord event emitted, waiting for release |
| `BTN_CLASSIFIER_REPEAT_ACTIVE` | repeat events active for one or more held buttons |
| `BTN_CLASSIFIER_LOCKED` | classifier suppressed by modal/power/maintenance policy |

Classifier rules:

- Chords are emitted as raw button masks.
- Chords must not be mapped to actions in Platform.
- Repeat events are generated by Platform but may be ignored by focus/context policy.
- `BTN_BOOT` may participate only in application-visible system maintenance/recovery classification, not Engine/Game input. Firmware cannot classify the early ROM bootloader path.

## Start Shipping Overlay

`BTN_START` has an additional policy overlay because it shares intent with ADP5360 `MR` behavior.

| Overlay State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `START_IDLE` | Start not pressed |
| `START_NORMAL_PRESS` | normal press window |
| `START_LONG_PRESS` | normal long-press window |
| `START_SHIP_PREP` | firmware should begin save/quiesce preparation |
| `START_SHIP_WARNING` | firmware should present warning/countdown if display policy allows |
| `START_SHIP_IMMINENT` | hardware shipping-mode threshold is approaching |
| `START_RELEASED` | Start released before hardware shipping-mode entry |

Overlay events:

- `EV_START_PRESS`
- `EV_START_LONG_THRESHOLD`
- `EV_START_SHIP_PREP_THRESHOLD`
- `EV_START_SHIP_WARN_THRESHOLD`
- `EV_START_SHIP_IMMINENT_THRESHOLD`
- `EV_START_RELEASE`

Published events:

- `INPUT_START_SHIP_PREP`
- `INPUT_START_SHIP_WARNING`
- `INPUT_START_SHIP_IMMINENT`
- `INPUT_START_RELEASED_BEFORE_SHIP`

These events are power/save intent. They are not game input.

## Logical Event Model

Platform may publish:

- `INPUT_BUTTON_DOWN`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_UP`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_PRESS`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_LONG_PRESS`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_REPEAT`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_CHORD`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_STUCK`
- `INPUT_BUTTON_MAINTENANCE`
- `INPUT_START_SHIP_PREP`
- `INPUT_START_SHIP_WARNING`
- `INPUT_START_SHIP_IMMINENT`

Payload should include:

- button ID
- active level
- duration in ms
- repeat count
- chord mask
- timestamp
- source, such as normal, wake, maintenance, or power intent

Exact payload shape belongs in [[Interface_Control_Document]].

## Wake Policy

| Button | Wake Policy |
|---|---|
| `BTN_START` | primary wake/sleep/user power-intent button |
| `BTN_A` / `BTN_B` / `BTN_L` / `BTN_R` | optional/contextual wake sources |
| `BTN_BOOT` | ROM bootloader before app if sampled high at reset; otherwise application-visible maintenance/recovery only, not normal input |

`BTN_START` shipping intent must be routed to power/save policy early enough for state preservation work.

## Mode Behavior

| Mode | Button Policy |
|---|---|
| `SHELL` | normal Start/A/B/L/R input; maintenance handling for application-visible `BTN_BOOT` |
| `LP_GRAPH` | `BTN_START` wake primary; other buttons armed only if declared by policy |
| `LP_TEMPLATE` | focus-controlled button set and repeat policy |
| `RT_SCENE` | focus-controlled button set; repeats/chords allowed if requested |
| `INSTALLER` | local navigation subset only; Start power intent remains active |

## Validation Cases

1. active-high buttons debounce correctly and emit press/release duration
2. active-low Start debounce correctly emits normal press/long press
3. repeat generation can be enabled and ignored by focus policy
4. chord window emits raw chord masks without Platform action mapping
5. `BTN_BOOT` is excluded from Engine/Game input and early BOOT0 ROM entry is not claimed as firmware-handled
6. Start shipping-prep event fires before warning/imminent thresholds
7. Start release before hardware shipping threshold cancels firmware countdown
8. stuck button suppresses repeat spam and emits fault
9. wake from Start works from supported low-power modes
10. optional wake buttons obey Platform policy
