# Package Manager State Machine

This document defines explicit state machines for package catalog/index handling and package install/activation.

---

## Scope

Defines:
- package catalog and index readiness FSM
- install transaction FSM
- package activation FSM

Does not define:
- installer transport ownership details (see [[Storage_and_Installer_Contract]])

---

## 1) Catalog and Index FSM

States:
- `PKG_INDEX_UNINITIALIZED`
- `PKG_INDEX_LOADING`
- `PKG_INDEX_READY`
- `PKG_INDEX_REBUILDING`
- `PKG_INDEX_ERROR`

Key events:
- `EV_BOOT`
- `EV_INDEX_LOAD_OK`
- `EV_INDEX_LOAD_FAIL`
- `EV_INDEX_REBUILD_REQ`
- `EV_INDEX_REBUILD_OK`
- `EV_INDEX_REBUILD_FAIL`
- `EV_INDEX_RECOVER_OK`

Rules:
- Package selection is illegal unless state is `PKG_INDEX_READY`.
- Rebuild operations must be bounded and fault-visible.

---

## 2) Install Transaction FSM

States:
- `PKG_INSTALL_IDLE`
- `PKG_INSTALL_STAGE`
- `PKG_INSTALL_VALIDATE`
- `PKG_INSTALL_COMMIT`
- `PKG_INSTALL_INDEX_UPDATE`
- `PKG_INSTALL_DONE`
- `PKG_INSTALL_ROLLBACK`
- `PKG_INSTALL_ERROR`

Key events:
- `EV_INSTALL_REQUEST`
- `EV_STAGE_OK`
- `EV_STAGE_FAIL`
- `EV_VALIDATE_OK`
- `EV_VALIDATE_FAIL`
- `EV_COMMIT_OK`
- `EV_COMMIT_FAIL`
- `EV_INDEX_UPDATE_OK`
- `EV_INDEX_UPDATE_FAIL`
- `EV_ROLLBACK_OK`
- `EV_ROLLBACK_FAIL`

Rules:
- Install state machine must preserve last known valid package set on failure.
- Commit and index update are not complete until both success events are observed.

---

## 3) Package Activation FSM

States:
- `PKG_ACTIVE_NONE`
- `PKG_ACTIVE_SELECTING`
- `PKG_ACTIVE_PREPARE_RUNTIME`
- `PKG_ACTIVE_RUNNING`
- `PKG_ACTIVE_SUSPENDED`
- `PKG_ACTIVE_RETURNING`
- `PKG_ACTIVE_ERROR`

Key events:
- `EV_PACKAGE_SELECTED`
- `EV_RUNTIME_PREPARE_OK`
- `EV_RUNTIME_PREPARE_FAIL`
- `EV_RUNTIME_STARTED`
- `EV_RUNTIME_SUSPENDED`
- `EV_RUNTIME_RESUMED`
- `EV_RUNTIME_EXITED`
- `EV_PACKAGE_FAULT`

Rules:
- Activation state must remain aligned with runtime manager state.
- Any mismatch routes to `PKG_ACTIVE_ERROR` and safe return to shell path.

---

## Required Integration

- Package manager transitions are owned by runtime/storage coordination layer.
- Storage owner performs data operations; package manager tracks logical transaction state.
- Index writes and commits must emit auditable transition logs.

---

## Validation Cases

1. clean install and activation path
2. failure at each install stage preserves last known valid state
3. index rebuild and recovery path correctness
4. runtime launch and return synchronization
5. invalid transitions rejected with explicit errors
