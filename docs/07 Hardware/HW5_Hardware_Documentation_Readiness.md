# HW5 Hardware Documentation Readiness

This note tracks what must be documented before CubeMX generation and firmware implementation are allowed to shape architecture.

Hardware documentation is considered ready when the board authority docs, platform contracts, and bring-up runbooks agree with each other.

Hardware-dependent constants, timings, thresholds, and budgets that still require HW5 measurement are tracked in [[Pending_Measured_Constants_Register]].

## Current Priority

Reference Game expansion is paused.

Current documentation priority is HW5 hardware, Platform contracts, and bring-up procedure coverage.

Active CubeMX file:

- `firmware/peepshow_hw5_fw1/peepshow_hw5_fw1.ioc`

## Readiness Gates

| Gate | Required Notes | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pin authority | [[HW5_CubeMX_Pin_Map]], [[HW5_Pin_Ownership_Matrix]] | Drafted | must stay aligned with `.ioc` and schematic |
| part identity | [[HW5_Part_Tokens]] | Mostly resolved | exact rotary encoder model unknown; documented as TTC green encoder |
| power and safe defaults | [[HW5_Power_Rails]], [[PMIC_and_Power_Contract]] | Drafted | primary GPIO polarities recorded; NINA auxiliary pins changed to `GPIO_Analog` safe defaults in current `.ioc` |
| clocks | [[HW5_Clock_Tree_Contract]], [[CubeMX_Configuration_Checklist]] | Drafted | SAI1 and OCTOSPI1 CubeMX baseline recorded; OCTOSPI performance tuning remains later work |
| DMA | [[HW5_DMA_Map]] | Drafted | buffer regions/alignment still need final firmware memory plan |
| wake sources | [[HW5_Wake_Sources]] | Drafted | encoder and sensor wake depth require measured proof |
| state machines | [[Subsystem_State_Machines]] and subsystem contracts | Drafted | transition tables can be expanded during implementation planning |
| bring-up evidence path | [[Brought_Up_Tracker]] plus runbooks | In progress | runbook coverage is drafted; measured HW5 evidence is still required |

## Bring-Up Runbook Coverage

| Subsystem | Contract | Runbook | Status |

## Known Documentation Gaps

- Keep CubeMX GPIO modes for NINA auxiliary pins as `GPIO_Analog`: `NINA_SW1`, `NINA_SW2`, `NINA_DTR`, and `NINA_DSR` are safe high-Z/no-pull defaults unless intentionally reconfigured by `thComm`.
- Confirm generated GPIO init order preserves NINA analog defaults before releasing `NINA_NRST`.
- Confirm generated GPIO init drives active-low `VLT_LCD` high/disabled before display owner policy is ready.
- Define DMA buffer memory regions and alignment once memory layout is planned.
- Assign exact offset/size for the protected external flash fault-log ring region near the end of flash before implementing persistent fault evidence.
- BLE first bring-up uses interrupt-driven RX/TX static ring buffers; DMA remains deferred until throughput or CPU measurements justify it.
- Fill measured LPBAM display experiment results during display/sleep bring-up.
- Record LS013B7DH05 pixel polarity, line address format, row order, byte order, dirty granularity, and full-frame fallback threshold from measured pattern tests.
- Record AT25SL128A JEDEC/device ID bytes, status/config register meanings used by the driver, scratch test range, and deep-power-down wake timing from measured HW5 tests.
- Confirm ADP5360 uses the public 7-bit I2C address convention from [[Platform_Hardware_Abstraction_Contract]], then record threshold constants, PMIC interrupt polarity/clear behavior, VBUS cross-check behavior, and safe evidence for low/critical battery policy.
- Record speaker DMA buffer sizing, MAX98357A enable settle timing, BBB frequency/duration bounds, and measured music plus 5 SFX mixer budget.
- Record sleep-class current, wake latency, resume latency, owner quiesce timeouts, and unknown-wake evidence for every supported runtime class.
- Complete the LIS2DUX12 post-baseline optimization pass so step counting is proven in the lowest-power polling mode, not only the ST 25 Hz/+/-4 g bring-up configuration.
- Measure TMAG3001 threshold values, hysteresis, sleep interval, axis mapping, and final `JOY_INT` polarity before implementing joystick wake policy.
- Measure rotary encoder settle time, sign convention, detent ratio, input filtering needs, acceleration knobs, and wake-armed current before finalizing input policy.
- Measure TEMT6000 settle time, dark/room/bright ADC values, normalized bands, filtering policy, and streaming limits before finalizing light-sensor API behavior.
- Verify generated EXTI edge configuration, button logic levels, debounce timing, chord/repeat behavior, Start shipping-prep thresholds, and BOOT0 application/ROM boundary on HW5.

## Before CubeMX Generation Checklist

1. Confirm all hardware docs reference the active `.ioc` path.
2. Resolve pin ownership conflicts between [[HW5_CubeMX_Pin_Map]] and [[HW5_Pin_Ownership_Matrix]].
3. Confirm all wake-capable EXTI paths are documented in [[HW5_Wake_Sources]].
4. Confirm every physical subsystem has a bring-up runbook.
5. Confirm every runbook says what evidence must be recorded in [[Brought_Up_Tracker]].
6. Confirm all safe defaults are either resolved or explicitly marked as bring-up unknowns.
7. Confirm the Platform owner thread for every peripheral is documented.
8. Confirm CubeMX generated initial output states cannot violate NINA startup/reset or display OE policy.

## Rule

A subsystem is not known-good until measured evidence is linked from [[Brought_Up_Tracker]].
