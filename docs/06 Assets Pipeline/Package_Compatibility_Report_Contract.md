# Package Compatibility Report Contract

This document defines the compatibility report produced by PeepOS package tooling.

The compatibility report is the bridge between a package, a selected target profile, the capability registry, package schemas, and the build profile used for export.

It is diagnostic and reproducibility metadata. It does not grant capabilities, mutate target profiles, or replace firmware install validation.

## Purpose

Every package build must produce a compatibility report.

The report answers:

- which package was built
- which target profile it was checked against
- which schemas and tools produced the result
- which runtime units exist
- which capabilities are required, optional, granted, blocked, mocked, or waived
- which budgets were consumed
- which validation results block export or remain as warnings
- whether the report is valid for shipping, development, preview, or digital twin use

The report is also the primary artifact used by authoring tools to explain rejection reasons in PeepOS terms.

---

## Boundary

The compatibility report may contain:

- package identity and checksums
- selected build profile
- selected target profile identity, version, status, and hash
- tool and schema versions
- runtime unit inventory
- capability admission results
- budget summaries
- validation issues
- waivers
- artifact references

The compatibility report must not contain:

- HAL, LL, register, DMA, clock, pin, or RTOS object names
- filesystem paths needed by runtime behavior
- flash offsets, erase pages, raw storage regions, SRAM bank names, linker sections, heap regions, or DMA buffer addresses
- debug transport ownership
- Platform knob values that are not published through target profiles
- host machine secrets or local absolute paths

Internal verifier logs may contain lower-level toolchain debugging detail, but those logs are not the normal package compatibility report shown to game authors.

---

## Report Status

Allowed report statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `passed` | package is compatible with the selected target/build profile |
| `passed_with_waivers` | compatible only because allowed warnings were explicitly waived |
| `preview_only` | usable for authoring preview or host mocks, not dev-device or shipping export |
| `dev_only` | usable for development target profiles, not shipping export |
| `failed` | package cannot be built/exported for the selected target/build profile |
| `stale` | report was valid when produced but no longer matches source hashes, profile hash, schema versions, or package checksum |

Shipping export requires `passed` or an explicitly release-policy-allowed `passed_with_waivers`.

`package_path` is a package/schema path such as a runtime unit, asset ID, schedule ID, or content parameter ID. It must not be a host absolute filesystem path.

## Validation Categories

Compatibility report categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| `manifest` | package identity, entry point, schema version |
| `runtime_units` | runtime class, declared transitions, fallback route |
| `runtime_logic` | states, guards, actions, queues, bounded execution |
| `capabilities` | required/optional grants, fallback behavior |
| `power_time` | inactivity route, cadence, schedules, calendar use |
| `rendering` | logical surface, layers, tone5, low-power sequence assets |
| `assets` | chunk bounds, decode budget, deterministic conversion |
| `input` | logical input bindings, focus scopes, wake intents |
| `sensors` | sensor contexts, cadence, wake capability |
| `audio` | cues, voices, format, mute policy |
| `communication` | sessions, message schemas, rates, wake restrictions |
| `save_settings` | schema, migration, write policy, persistence results |
| `diagnostics` | marker/counter/timing limits, shipping policy |
| `package_limits` | size, RAM, string, content parameter, diagnostic budgets |
| `internal_safety` | forbidden internal symbols in generated artifacts |
| `determinism` | reproducible output, stable ordering, checksum mismatch |

User-facing messages must use PeepOS package language. Low-level internal terms belong in `internal_detail_ref`, not in normal authoring messages.

---

## Severity Model

The report uses the severity model from [[Game_Authoring_API_Contract]]:

| Severity | Blocks Shipping |
|---|---:|
| `fatal` | yes |
| `error` | yes |
| `warning` | yes unless waived by release policy |
| `advisory` | no |
| `waived` | no if release policy allows the waiver |

Warnings that affect runtime safety, determinism, storage integrity, power policy, or capability availability must escalate to `error`.

---

## Capability Admission

Capability admission compares package declarations with the selected target profile.

Rules:

- required capabilities must be granted by the target profile.
- optional capabilities require declared fallback behavior.
- session-required communication or audio-centric behavior is valid only when explicitly declared and bounded.
- `pending_validation` grants block shipping export.
- mocked capabilities are preview/dev-only and must not appear as shipping-compatible.
- development-only inputs or capabilities must be stripped, nulled, or rejected on non-dev target profiles.
- a package may carry precomposed low-power sequence assets when supported, but autonomous playback requires `display.autonomous_sequence` to be granted.

Capability names must come from [[PeepOS_Capability_Registry]].

---

## Budget Reporting

Budget summaries must include:

- target limit
- package requested/used value
- unit of measure
- status
- source path or package ID

Budget entries must use target-profile abstractions such as package bytes, asset bytes, runtime RAM bytes, save/settings bytes, frame budget, message size, event rate, or low-power sequence bytes.

Budget entries must not expose memory-map or hardware-transfer facts.

---

## Waivers

Waivers are allowed only for warnings or advisories unless a special development profile explicitly permits a preview-only mock.

Rules:

- waivers must have reason, owner, and removal condition.
- waivers must list allowed build profiles.
- waivers must be included in the report.
- waivers must not hide fatal, schema, integrity, deterministic-build, required-capability, power-policy, or runtime-safety failures in shipping exports.
- waivers used for preview or mocked behavior are not hardware bring-up evidence.

---

## Determinism And Staleness

The report must become stale if any of these change:

- package checksum
- source manifest checksum
- selected target profile hash
- capability registry hash
- package schema version
- asset compiler version where output semantics change
- content parameter checksum
- selected build profile
- waiver set

Reports retained inside deterministic package payloads must not include hidden timestamps or host-local paths.

If a human-readable sidecar includes generation time, that timestamp must be outside the deterministic package checksum or otherwise explicitly excluded from deterministic rebuild comparison.

---

## Package Embedding

The package blob may include a `compat_report` chunk for diagnostics.

Rules:

- installer validation must not trust the report as proof of package safety.
- installer validation must re-check package integrity, schema compatibility, runtime class compatibility, and required capability compatibility.
- a report embedded in a package must match the package checksum or be ignored as stale.
- a sidecar report may include richer authoring detail than an embedded report.

---

## Digital Twin Use

The digital twin may use compatibility reports to:

- choose the correct target/twin profile
- reject stale or incompatible packages before launch
- show authoring diagnostics
- seed replay manifests with package/profile/report hashes
- explain mocked or preview-only capabilities

The digital twin must still enforce runtime contracts directly. A compatibility report does not bypass runtime validation.

---

## Required Validation Cases

1. package requiring a blocked capability produces `failed`.
2. package using optional capability without fallback produces `failed`.
3. package using a pending-validation capability produces `preview_only` or `dev_only`, not shipping-compatible.
4. package exceeding any target-profile budget produces a blocking issue.
5. package with allowed waived warning produces `passed_with_waivers`.
6. package with waived runtime-safety error still fails shipping export.
7. package report becomes stale after target profile hash changes.
8. package report becomes stale after package checksum changes.
9. embedded report mismatch is ignored by installer diagnostics and does not affect installer validation authority.
10. user-facing messages do not expose HAL, RTOS, filesystem, flash-offset, SRAM, DMA, register, or debug-transport terms during normal authoring.
11. compatibility report contains no host absolute paths required by runtime behavior.
12. digital twin rejects a package whose report targets a different source target profile unless explicitly revalidated.

---

## Rule

The compatibility report records the result of package validation against a target profile.

It is evidence of tool-side validation, not a substitute for firmware install validation or hardware bring-up evidence.
