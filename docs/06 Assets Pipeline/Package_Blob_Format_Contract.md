# Package Blob Format Contract

This document defines the conceptual PeepOS package blob format produced by tooling and consumed by the installer, package manager, runtime hosts, and digital twin.

The package blob format is game/content-facing. It must not encode RTOS objects, HAL handles, filesystem paths, flash addresses, SRAM4 addresses, DMA descriptors, LPBAM descriptors, SPI payloads, or hardware row formats.

---

## Name And Version

The conceptual container name is `PeepPkg`.

Initial binary format examples use the magic/version family `PKG1`.

`PKG1` is a package-container format marker, not a package API version. Individual schemas and chunk formats still carry their own versions.

---

## Container Shape

```text
PeepPkg:
  package_header
  manifest_chunk
  chunk_table
  chunks[]
  integrity_footer
```

The blob must be deterministic from identical inputs.

Runtime code must not scan directories or parse editor-native source files. It resolves assets, schemas, and runtime data through the package manifest, asset table, and chunk table.

---

## Package Header

Conceptual fields:

```text
package_header:
  magic
  container_format_version
  header_size
  package_id
  package_version
  package_size_bytes
  manifest_chunk_id
  chunk_table_offset
  chunk_count
  alignment
  package_flags
  header_crc
```

Rules:

- `magic` must match the supported container family.
- `container_format_version` must be explicitly accepted by firmware/tooling.
- `package_size_bytes` must match the staged blob size.
- offsets and sizes must be bounded and inside the package blob.
- alignment must be explicit and compatible with the installed raw storage reader.
- header fields must not contain host paths or hardware addresses.

---

## Manifest Chunk

The manifest chunk contains the normalized package manifest described in [[Package_Contract]].

It includes:

- package identity and version
- build profile and target profile
- runtime units
- required and optional capabilities
- package power policy
- asset table reference
- save schema reference
- message schema reference
- compatibility constraints
- package checksum reference

The manifest is the authority for package admission. Runtime code may request less than the manifest declares, but it must not request undeclared capabilities or undeclared assets.

---

## Chunk Table

Every package payload entry is represented by a chunk table entry.

Conceptual fields:

```text
chunk_entry:
  chunk_id
  chunk_type
  format_version
  byte_offset
  byte_size
  alignment
  crc32
  required_capability
  runtime_unit_refs[]
  load_policy
  flags
```

Rules:

- chunk IDs are stable within the package.
- tooling may use symbolic IDs; runtime may use compact numeric indexes after validation.
- `chunk_type` must be known or explicitly skippable.
- `format_version` must be accepted for the selected runtime/profile.
- chunk byte ranges must not overlap unless a future schema explicitly allows shared data.
- chunk ranges must remain inside the package blob.
- every chunk has corruption-detection metadata.
- unknown required chunks reject the package.
- unknown optional chunks may be ignored only when the manifest declares a valid fallback.

---

## Stable IDs

Authoring and package manifests use stable symbolic asset IDs.

Firmware/runtime implementations may map those IDs to compact numeric indexes during validation or install.

Rules:

- duplicate symbolic IDs are invalid.
- unresolved asset references are invalid.
- asset IDs must not be filesystem paths.
- renaming source files must not silently change stable package IDs unless tooling reports it.

---

## Required Chunk Types

Initial chunk types:

| Chunk Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest` | normalized package manifest |
| `asset_table` | asset IDs, metadata, and chunk references |
| `runtime_unit_table` | runtime unit records, entries, transitions, and budgets |
| `time_power_profile` | calendar requirements, schedule table metadata, wake intents, cadence hints, and catch-up policy |
| `state_graph` | bounded runtime logic, graph, event, action, and scene/module state data |
| `input_map` | logical input bindings and focus scopes |
| `audio_profile` | symbolic cue tables, BBB pattern metadata, audio contexts, and timeline markers |
| `sensor_profile` | PeepOS sensor contexts, event interests, step sessions, and wake intents |
| `save_schema` | save records, package-owned settings, defaults, migration policy, reset policy, and write budget |
| `communication_profile` | session contexts, roles, message schema references, rate limits, and routing behavior |
| `message_schema` | communication message types, payload schemas, limits, and compatibility policy |
| `diagnostics_profile` | package marker, counter, timing, warning, and package fault code metadata |
| `masked_1bpp_sprite_bank` | crisp masked 1bpp sprite/image data |
| `tone5_sprite_bank` | tone5 masked sprite/image data |
| `tileset_bank` | bounded tile graphics and tile metadata |
| `tilemap` | compact map layers, regions, collision, and data tables |
| `animation_table` | frame references, timing, loop policy, and bounds |
| `font_bank` | package fonts and text layout metadata |
| `text_table` | localized/string table data |
| `audio_bank` | music/SFX audio payloads such as bounded ADPCM blocks |
| `bbb_pattern_bank` | bounded buzzer/beeper/buzzer pattern data |
| `low_power_sequence` | portable precomposed 1bpp low-power sequence candidate |
| `data_table` | bounded generic package data |
| `compat_report` | tooling compatibility report retained for diagnostics |

Chunk type names are conceptual. Final binary IDs live in the schema files.

---

## Asset Table Chunk

The asset table maps stable asset IDs to chunk entries and runtime metadata.

Conceptual fields:

```text
asset_record:
  asset_id
  asset_type
  chunk_id
  format_version
  byte_size
  bounds
  required_capability
  optional_capability_fallback
  runtime_unit_refs[]
  memory_budget
  decode_budget
  checksum
```

Rules:

- every runtime asset reference must resolve through the asset table.
- asset records must declare bounds before runtime use.
- asset records must declare capability requirements.
- asset records must declare memory/decode budget where applicable.
- assets must not reference editor-native source paths.

---

## Rendering Chunk Requirements

Rendering chunks must follow [[Rendering_API_Contract]].

Rules:

- `masked_1bpp_sprite_bank` stores black/white pixels with opacity masks.
- `tone5_sprite_bank` stores semantic tone5 content and opacity/ownership metadata.
- `tileset_bank` declares tile size, pixel model, allowed scale, and layout.
- `tilemap` declares dimensions, layers, collision/data tables, viewport assumptions, and tileset references.
- `animation_table` declares frame references, frame timing, loop policy, and bounds.
- `font_bank` declares glyph metrics, supported codepoints or string-table bindings, and layout limits.
- no rendering chunk may encode panel-native framebuffer addresses, physical LCD row numbers, SRAM4 addresses, SPI bytes, DMA descriptors, or LPBAM descriptors.

---

## Low-Power Sequence Chunk

`low_power_sequence` is portable package data.

Conceptual fields:

```text
low_power_sequence:
  sequence_id
  logical_width
  logical_height
  pixel_model
  frames[]
  frame_duration_ms[]
  loop_policy
  max_runtime_policy
  wake_exit_policy
  fallback_unit
  checksum
```

Rules:

- `pixel_model` must be `precomposed_1bpp` for v1 low-power playback candidates.
- frames are logical PeepOS display content, not Sharp LCD row payloads.
- the chunk must not contain SRAM4 placement, SPI command bytes, LPBAM linked lists, or physical row addressing.
- tooling must validate frame count, total byte size, cadence, loop policy, and target-profile limits.
- the digital twin may preview the sequence from this portable chunk.
- hardware autonomous playback requires `display.autonomous_sequence` and measured Platform support.
- Platform may convert or cache the validated sequence as full frames, row deltas, repeated payloads, or another display-owner format.

---

## Compression And Packing

V1 runtime paths do not allow general-purpose compression.

Allowed packing is format-specific and bounded:

- bitplanes
- opacity masks
- tone planes
- fixed-layout tilemaps
- IMA ADPCM or other explicitly documented bounded audio payloads
- simple RLE only when the chunk format defines a bounded decoder, maximum expansion size, and decode budget

Rules:

- no unbounded decompression.
- no package-controlled heap allocation for decompression.
- no streaming decompressor whose worst-case time or output size is unknown.
- expansion size must be known before runtime decode.
- packages must remain usable when optional compressed assets fall back to uncompressed or lower-cost alternatives, where declared.

---

## Integrity Model

V1 integrity requirements:

- header CRC for early rejection of malformed packages
- per-chunk CRC32 or equivalent corruption check
- whole-package checksum over installable payload
- schema version list in the manifest or compatibility report
- optional signature/authentication placeholder for future policy

Rules:

- install-time validation must recompute and verify checksums.
- runtime must not mount or execute packages with failed required chunk integrity.
- failed optional chunks may be ignored only if the manifest declares fallback behavior.
- checksum/signature metadata is not a substitute for schema and bounds validation.

---

## Install And Runtime Loading

Installer flow:

1. host places package blob into USB staging/export storage.
2. `thStorage` reclaims and rescans staging/export after host release.
3. package manager validates the blob, manifest, chunk table, schemas, capabilities, bounds, and checksums.
4. validated package is committed to installed raw package storage.
5. installed index/metadata is updated atomically from the package-manager perspective.

Runtime flow:

- runtime loads assets through [[Package_Asset_Loading_API_Contract]] by asset ID.
- runtime reads installed raw package storage or bounded RAM caches only.
- runtime does not read FAT/FileX staging paths.
- runtime does not parse JSON, PNG, Aseprite, Tiled, WAV, or other editor-native files.
- runtime unit activation may load only assets declared for that runtime unit or approved shared assets.

---

## Validation Requirements

Tooling and installer validation must reject:

- unsupported container format
- malformed header or chunk table
- chunk ranges outside the blob
- overlapping chunk ranges
- checksum or CRC mismatch
- duplicate asset IDs
- unresolved asset or runtime-unit references
- unknown required chunk types
- unsupported required chunk versions
- asset bounds that exceed target profile limits
- runtime unit using assets not declared for that unit
- missing fallback for optional capabilities
- package requiring autonomous playback for a low-power sequence when `display.autonomous_sequence` is unavailable
- package artifacts containing host paths, hardware addresses, RTOS symbols, filesystem API requirements, SRAM4 addresses, SPI payloads, DMA descriptors, or LPBAM descriptors
- nondeterministic rebuild output for identical inputs

---

## Compatibility Report

Every package build must produce a compatibility report.

The report must include:

- tool version
- package container version
- schema versions
- target profile
- capability compatibility/admission summary
- runtime unit inventory
- runtime logic budget summary
- asset inventory
- chunk inventory
- memory/decode/render budget summary
- warnings and waivers
- package checksum

The report is diagnostic metadata. It does not replace installer validation.
